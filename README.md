# IoU from Scratch

## Introduction

This repository implements the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric from scratch using PyTorch. IoU is a crucial metric in object detection tasks, where it is used to evaluate the accuracy of predicted bounding boxes against ground truth bounding boxes.

## What is IoU?

Intersection over Union (IoU) is a metric used to measure the overlap between two bounding boxes. It is defined as the area of the intersection divided by the area of the union of the two boxes.

### Visual Representation

In the above image:

- The red box represents the predicted bounding box.
- The blue box represents the ground truth bounding box.
- The purple area is the intersection between the two boxes.
- The union is the combined area of both boxes.

### Use Cases

IoU is widely used in computer vision tasks, particularly in object detection and segmentation. Here are some of its common use cases:

1. **Object Detection**: In object detection, IoU is used to compare the predicted bounding boxes with the ground truth boxes to determine the accuracy of the predictions. A higher IoU indicates a better match between the predicted and actual bounding boxes.

2. **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)**: In object detection algorithms like YOLO or SSD, IoU is used in the NMS step to eliminate redundant bounding boxes that overlap too much, keeping only the most confident predictions.

3. **Image Segmentation**: IoU is also used in semantic and instance segmentation tasks to evaluate how well the predicted segmentation masks match the ground truth masks.

## Repository Structure

- `IoU.py`: Contains the `intersection_over_union` function, which computes the IoU for two bounding boxes.
- `IoU_tests.py`: Contains unit tests to verify the correctness of the IoU implementation.

## Installation

To use this code, you'll need Python 3.x and PyTorch installed. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install torch
```

## Usage

### IoU Calculation

You can calculate the IoU between two bounding boxes by importing the `intersection_over_union` function from `IoU.py`.

```python
import torch
from IoU import intersection_over_union

box1 = torch.tensor([.5, .5, .2, .2])
box2 = torch.tensor([.6, .6, .2, .2])

iou = intersection_over_union(box1, box2, box_format='midpoint')
print(f'IoU: {iou.item():.4f}')
```

This will run all the unit tests defined in `IoU_tests.py` and print the results.

### Example Outputs

Here's an example of the IoU calculation for different scenarios:

```bash
# Example 1: Partial overlap
box1 = torch.tensor([.8, .1, .2, .2])
box2 = torch.tensor([.9, .2, .2, .2])
iou = intersection_over_union(box1, box2, box_format='midpoint')
print(f'IoU: {iou.item():.4f}')  # Expected IoU: 0.1429

# Example 2: Complete overlap
box1 = torch.tensor([.5, .5, .2, .2])
box2 = torch.tensor([.5, .5, .2, .2])
iou = intersection_over_union(box1, box2, box_format='midpoint')
print(f'IoU: {iou.item():.4f}')  # Expected IoU: 1.0000
```

## Types of Tests in `IoU_tests.py`

The `IoU_tests.py` file contains a variety of unit tests that cover different scenarios for the IoU calculation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the types of tests included:

1. **Test for Overlapping Boxes (`test_both_inside_cell_shares_area`)**:
    - **Scenario**: Tests the IoU when both boxes partially overlap.
    - **Example**: A small overlap between two boxes centered at different points.
    - **Expected Outcome**: IoU is a positive value less than 1.

2. **Test for Partial Overlap (`test_partially_outside_cell_shares_area`)**:
    - **Scenario**: Checks the IoU when one box is slightly outside the boundary of the other.
    - **Example**: Boxes share some area but not completely overlapping.
    - **Expected Outcome**: IoU is a positive value that accounts for the shared area.

3. **Test for No Overlap (`test_both_inside_cell_shares_no_area`)**:
    - **Scenario**: Verifies IoU calculation when there is no overlap between the boxes.
    - **Example**: Boxes are positioned such that they do not touch each other.
    - **Expected Outcome**: IoU is 0.

4. **Test for Complete Overlap (`test_both_inside_cell_shares_entire_area`)**:
    - **Scenario**: Tests the IoU when one box is exactly the same as the other.
    - **Example**: Two identical boxes in the same location.
    - **Expected Outcome**: IoU is 1.

5. **Test for Midpoint Format (`test_midpoint_outside_cell_shares_area`)**:
    - **Scenario**: Ensures correct IoU calculation when boxes are defined using the midpoint format.
    - **Example**: Boxes defined by their center coordinates and width/height.
    - **Expected Outcome**: Accurate IoU calculation based on the midpoint representation.

6. **Test for Corner Coordinates Format (`test_box_format_x1_y1_x2_y2`)**:
    - **Scenario**: Validates IoU calculation when boxes are defined using corner coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2).
    - **Example**: Boxes represented by the coordinates of their top-left and bottom-right corners.
    - **Expected Outcome**: IoU should be accurately calculated using corner coordinates.

7. **Test for Multiple Boxes (Batch Processing) (`test_additional_and_batch`)**:
    - **Scenario**: Tests the IoU calculation when dealing with a batch of multiple boxes.
    - **Example**: Multiple predicted and ground truth boxes evaluated in a single function call.
    - **Expected Outcome**: Correct IoU values for each pair of boxes in the batch.

### Running Tests
